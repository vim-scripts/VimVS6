This script provides a way to compile and link MS Visual Studio 6 C++       
projects, jump to compiler errors, start .exe file and look up in MSDN   
help files from within VIM.                                              
There are other projects that try to integrate VIM in Visual Studio.     
VimVS6 does it the other way around and tries to integrate Visual Studio 
in VIM ;-)   (don't take this too seriously)                             
                                                                         
Visual Studio can export a make file for nmake (see menu                 
Project -> Export Makefile... in Visual Studio). Nmake is included in    
Visual Studio 6. VimVS6 compiles a Visual Studio 6 project using nmake   
and the exported makefile.                                               
                                                                         
Usage:                                                                   
  <F5>:    make project                                                  
  <S-F5>:  make all                                                      
  <C-F5>:  start .exe file                                               
  <F2>:    search for help in MSDN files for word under cursor           
                                                                         
  Once per VIM session the function VVS_SetEnvironment() must be called  
  to specify paths VimVS6 looks for the project files.                   
  Do   :call VVS_SetEnvironment( 'projectpath', 'projectname' )          
                                                                         
  E.g. :call VVS_SetEnvironment( 'f:\prog\GALer', 'GALer' )              
                                                                         
  This call is not needed if only MSDN help search is used.

For details on configuration see script header.
